 读入数据集，然后了解数据集的大小，用直方图看看数值的分布。但是仍然有以下问题，继而引出今天的主题。
 how many rainy days were there in the year?
 What was the average precipitation on those rainy days?
 How many days were there with more than 10 mm of rainfall?


比较运算符得到某条规则的结果，而逻辑运算符，就能将规则的结果，好好地联系起来。比如得同时符合，或者只要符合规则之一等等。

- 利用六种比较运算符，得到布尔数组（Boolean Array）
- Combining comparison operators and Boolean operators on arrays can lead to a wide range of efficient logical operations.


Using comparison and Boolean operators, I can construct a Boolean array that represents elements matching some rule. Then, I can either aggregate the Boolean array itself (to count or proportion matching) or use it to mask the original array and aggregate those selected values.
