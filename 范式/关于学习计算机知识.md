Couple thoughts here....

2. People have different learning styles. For some, reading is sufficient, for others it's just a good way to feel like the goal of learning Docker is more impossible than ever. Think about your learning style and gear your studies toward those types of resources. There are good resources for each style, including books, articles, videos, tutorials, etc. As for finding these resources, see #2.
    
3. ==When encountering a new technology, search for "awesome" lists on github. ==There are usually multiple (especially for popular topics), but the best ones usually bubble to the surface. [https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker)
    
4. A quote I've heard and I find resonates: "I Hear and I Forget, I See and I Remember, I Do and I Understand". Find something and containerize it. You'll learn all sorts of quirks along the way. Just about every new thing you containerize will teach you something.
    

Best of luck, containerization is a really fun and interesting concept!
